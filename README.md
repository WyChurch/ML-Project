To ensure the Python notebooks run properly with our dataset, follow these steps:
- Unzip combined_matches_players_all_1.csv.zip
- Place resulting csv file into folder Data_Combined
- Run Feature_Engineering.ipynb
- Run Model_Data_Preparation.ipynb

The data is now ready for you to run Baseline_Models.ipynb in the Models folder.
