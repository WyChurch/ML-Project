        "\n",
        "- In this project, we want to predict the outcome of DoTA 2 matches using real game data from the OpenDota JSON Data Dump. Each match contains a huge amount of numeric information, including player statistics, gold and XP graphs, combat logs, item usage, time-series data, and other gameplay metrics. Our plan is to convert these JSON objects into a large, high-dimensional numeric dataset (well over 10 million floats) and then build machine learning models on top of it. We will start with simple baseline models to see how well raw features predict whether the Radiant team wins. After that, we’ll use dimensionality-reduction and HD-curse mitigation techniques—like PCA, Random Projection, and APP—to see if they improve performance or reveal hidden structure in the matches. The goal is not just to predict the winner, but also to learn something interesting about playstyles, match patterns, and how high-dimensional features interact.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In order to differentiate from prior OpenDota-based predictors, we will focus on discovering and analyzing emergent ‘playstyle archetypes’ at both team and player level (e.g., farm-heavy vs. fight-heavy lineups, objective‑centric vs. pickoff‑centric teams) in the learned low-dimensional spaces, rather than optimizing only for win‑prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We all like games and this project allowed us to be able to pull information and create a model that can predict matches. This was a cool concept because a lot of gaes have software that take statistic and give you percentages on game outcomes. We also wanted to learn how to pull data from an API ourselves versus downloading a zip file.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "- In competitive online games like DoTA, it’s extremely important to match players of similar skill levels. When a low-skill player gets paired against someone who is much more experienced, the outcome is almost always one-sided, which leads to frustration and a bad gameplay experience. At the same time, high-skill players don’t get much enjoyment from a match that offers no challenge. Over time, poor matchmaking can reduce player engagement and hurt the game’s long-term health and revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Being able to predict match outcomes based on pre-match and early-match features could help improve matchmaking systems by identifying patterns that separate balanced matches from mismatched ones. Understanding these patterns also helps explain what actually influences a fair, competitive game.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Our original question was can we use DoTA match data alongside ML algorithms to predict match outcomes based on learned player and team playstyles?\n",
        "- After feedback from the professor that a win-predictor was a very common machine learning project in this space, we knew we had to find an alternative angle to differentiate our model. This is when we devised the 'playstyle archetypes' approach to the problem. Each player and team plays the game differently, optimizing their strategy for different goals during the match. \n",
        "- Our original plan to use the OpenDota JSON Data Dump unfortunately fell through due to a variety of factors. The dataset was discovered to be too large and unwieldy for us to use, at over half a terabyte in size all-in. When trying to download it, the torrent linked on the website was found to be broken as well, so it would not be available to us. Pivoting from this, we found that we could call our own data using the OpenDota API. With this, we obtained our own dataset that fit the requirements of the project and gave us adequate floats to train our models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Dataset Exploration\n",
        "We successfully collected 104,219 professional DotA 2 matches using the OpenDota API. The dataset contains 16 features spanning match metadata, team statistics, objectives, advantages, events, and vision control metrics, yielding 16,675,040 individual float values.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Model Performance Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Exceptional Baseline Performance**: All four baseline models achieved accuracy scores above 99%, demonstrating that professional Dota 2 match outcomes are highly predictable from in-game statistics. This suggests that professional matches follow more deterministic patterns compared to casual play.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Logistic Regression Outperforms Random Forest**: Despite Random Forest's ability to capture non-linear relationships, Logistic Regression achieved slightly better performance (0.9960 vs 0.9933 accuracy on no-leak features). This indicates that the relationship between features and match outcomes may be more linear than initially expected, or that the feature engineering process has already captured the important non-linear patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Set Comparison**: The no-leak feature set (94 features) showed marginally better performance than the mid-game set (86 features), suggesting that the additional 8 features in the no-leak set contain valuable predictive information. However, the difference is minimal (0.0007 accuracy difference), indicating that mid-game features alone are highly predictive.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Feature Importance Alignment with Game Mechanics**: The feature importance analysis reveals that economic metrics (gold/XP ratios) and objective control (tower damage) are the strongest predictors, which aligns with Dota 2 gameplay fundamentals. Teams that maintain economic advantages and control objectives tend to win matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Comparative Analysis: Before vs. After Feature Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "**Before Feature Engineering** (Raw API Data):\n",
        "- Limited to basic match statistics\n",
        "- No derived ratios or advantage metrics\n",
        "- Missing aggregated time-series features\n",
        "\n",
        "**After Feature Engineering** (Current Feature Sets):\n",
        "- **No-Leak Set**: 94 engineered features including ratios, differences, and aggregated metrics\n",
        "- **Mid-Game Set**: 86 features focused on mid-game state (15-25 minutes)\n",
        "- Both sets include:\n",
        "  - Economic ratios (GPM, XPM ratios)\n",
        "  - Combat effectiveness metrics\n",
        "  - Objective control indicators\n",
        "  - Team advantage calculations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact**: The feature engineering process transformed raw match data into highly predictive features, enabling models to achieve 99%+ accuracy. The engineered features capture strategic game elements that raw statistics alone cannot represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Model Robustness\n",
        "\n",
        "All models demonstrated:\n",
        "- **High Precision**: Above 99.4% across all models, indicating minimal false positives\n",
        "- **High Recall**: Above 99.1% across all models, indicating minimal false negatives\n",
        "- **Balanced Performance**: F1-scores consistently above 99.2%, showing excellent precision-recall balance\n",
        "- **Low Error Rates**: Error rates below 0.5% across all models\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Limitations and Future Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Potential Overfitting**: The extremely high accuracy (99%+) may indicate overfitting to professional match patterns. Future work should include:\n",
        "   - Cross-validation on different time periods\n",
        "   - Testing on different skill brackets\n",
        "   - Regularization techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering Impact**: While feature engineering significantly improved predictive power, future work should quantify the exact contribution of each engineered feature category.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: As proposed in the original methodology, PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques should be explored to:\n",
        "   - Reduce computational complexity\n",
        "   - Identify latent playstyle patterns\n",

        "\n",
        "Our baseline models have successfully demonstrated that professional Dota 2 match outcomes can be predicted with exceptional accuracy using engineered features from in-game statistics. The models consistently achieve 99%+ accuracy, with Logistic Regression on scaled no-leak features performing best (99.60% accuracy). Feature importance analysis confirms that economic advantages and objective control are the primary determinants of match outcomes, aligning with game mechanics. These results provide a strong foundation for the next phase of the project, which will focus on dimensionality reduction and playstyle archetype discovery.\n",
