    "## 2. Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In this project, we want to predict the outcome of DoTA 2 matches using real game data from the OpenDota JSON Data Dump. Each match contains a huge amount of numeric information, including player statistics, gold and XP graphs, combat logs, item usage, time-series data, and other gameplay metrics. Our plan is to convert these JSON objects into a large, high-dimensional numeric dataset (well over 10 million floats) and then build machine learning models on top of it. We will start with simple baseline models to see how well raw features predict whether the Radiant team wins. After that, we’ll use dimensionality-reduction and HD-curse mitigation techniques—like PCA, Random Projection, and APP—to see if they improve performance or reveal hidden structure in the matches. The goal is not just to predict the winner, but also to learn something interesting about playstyles, match patterns, and how high-dimensional features interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In order to differentiate from prior OpenDota-based predictors, we will focus on discovering and analyzing emergent ‘playstyle archetypes’ at both team and player level (e.g., farm-heavy vs. fight-heavy lineups, objective‑centric vs. pickoff‑centric teams) in the learned low-dimensional spaces, rather than optimizing only for win‑prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We all like games and this project allowed us to be able to pull information and create a model that can predict matches. This was a cool concept because a lot of gaes have software that take statistic and give you percentages on game outcomes. We also wanted to learn how to pull data from an API ourselves versus downloading a zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In competitive online games like DoTA, it’s extremely important to match players of similar skill levels. When a low-skill player gets paired against someone who is much more experienced, the outcome is almost always one-sided, which leads to frustration and a bad gameplay experience. At the same time, high-skill players don’t get much enjoyment from a match that offers no challenge. Over time, poor matchmaking can reduce player engagement and hurt the game’s long-term health and revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    Being able to predict match outcomes based on pre-match and early-match features could help improve matchmaking systems by identifying patterns that separate balanced matches from mismatched ones. Understanding these patterns also helps explain what actually influences a fair, competitive game.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Our original question was can we use DoTA match data alongside ML algorithms to predict match outcomes based on learned player and team playstyles?\n",
    "-   After feedback from the professor that a win-predictor was a very common machine learning project in this space, we knew we had to find an alternative angle to differentiate our model. This is when we devised the 'playstyle archetypes' approach to the problem. Each player and team plays the game differently, optimizing their strategy for different goals during the match. \n",
    "-   Our original plan to use the OpenDota JSON Data Dump unfortunately fell through due to a variety of factors. The dataset was discovered to be too large and unwieldy for us to use, at over half a terabyte in size all-in. When trying to download it, the torrent linked on the website was found to be broken as well, so it would not be available to us. Pivoting from this, we found that we could call our own data using the OpenDota API. With this, we obtained our own dataset that fit the requirements of the project and gave us adequate floats to train our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Dataset Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "-    We successfully collected 15,000 professional DotA 2 matches using the OpenDota API. The dataset contains 65 features spanning match metadata, team statistics, objectives, advantages, events, and vision control metrics, yielding 750,000 individual float values.\n",

    "#\n",
    "After discovering that the original OpenDota JSON Data Dump was over 500GB with a broken torrent link, we pivoted to collecting data directly through the OpenDota API. This approach gave us more control over data quality and allowed us to focus specifically on professional matches where gameplay patterns are more consistent and strategic.\n",
