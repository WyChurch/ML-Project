        "-   In this project, we want to predict the outcome of DoTA 2 matches using real game data from\n",

        "including player statistics, gold and XP graphs, combat logs, item usage, time-series data, and\n",
        "other gameplay metrics. Our plan is to convert these JSON objects into a large, high-dimensional\n",
        "numeric dataset (well over 10 million floats) and then build machine learning models on top of it.\n",
        "We will start with simple baseline models to see how well raw features predict whether the Radiant\n",
        "team wins. After that, we’ll use dimensionality-reduction and HD-curse mitigation techniques—like\n",
        "PCA, Random Projection, and APP—to see if they improve performance or reveal hidden structure\n",
        "in the matches. The goal is not just to predict the winner, but also to learn something interesting\n",
        "about playstyles, match patterns, and how high-dimensional features interact.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   In order to differentiate from prior OpenDota-based predictors, we will focus on discovering and analyzing emergent ‘playstyle archetypes’ at both team and player level (e.g., farm-heavy vs. fight-heavy lineups, objective‑centric vs. pickoff‑centric teams) in the learned low-dimensional spaces, rather than optimizing only for win‑prediction accuracy.\n",
