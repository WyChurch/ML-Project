    "## Project Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In this project, we want to predict the outcome of DoTA 2 matches using real game data from\n",
    "the OpenDota JSON Data Dump. Each match contains a huge amount of numeric information,\n",
    "including player statistics, gold and XP graphs, combat logs, item usage, time-series data, and\n",
    "other gameplay metrics. Our plan is to convert these JSON objects into a large, high-dimensional\n",
    "numeric dataset (well over 10 million floats) and then build machine learning models on top of it.\n",
    "We will start with simple baseline models to see how well raw features predict whether the Radiant\n",
    "team wins. After that, we’ll use dimensionality-reduction and HD-curse mitigation techniques—like\n",
    "PCA, Random Projection, and APP—to see if they improve performance or reveal hidden structure\n",
    "in the matches. The goal is not just to predict the winner, but also to learn something interesting\n",
    "about playstyles, match patterns, and how high-dimensional features interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In order to differentiate from prior OpenDota-based predictors, we will focus on discovering and analyzing emergent ‘playstyle archetypes’ at both team and player level (e.g., farm-heavy vs. fight-heavy lineups, objective‑centric vs. pickoff‑centric teams) in the learned low-dimensional spaces, rather than optimizing only for win‑prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [ ] Expanded explanation, addressing all feedback and what has been\n",
    "    learned about dataset and the task since project proposal.\n",
    "-   In competitive online games like DoTA, it’s extremely important to match players of similar skill levels. When a low-skill player gets paired against someone who is much more experienced, the outcome is almost always one-sided, which leads to frustration and a bad gameplay experience. At the same time, high-skill players don’t get much enjoyment from a match that offers no challenge. Over time, poor matchmaking can reduce player engagement and hurt the game’s long-term health and revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to predict match outcomes based on pre-match and early-match features could help improve matchmaking systems by identifying patterns that separate balanced matches from mismatched ones. Understanding these patterns also helps explain what actually influences a fair, competitive game.\n",
    "-   Can we use DoTA match data alongside ML algorithms to predict match outcomes based on learned player and team playstyles?\n",
    "-   After feedback from the professor that a win-predictor was a very common machine learning project in this space, we knew we had to find an alternative angle to differentiate our model. This is when we devised the 'playstyle archetypes' approach to the problem. Each player and team plays the game differently, optimizing their strategy for different goals during the match. \n",
    "-   Our original plan to use the OpenDota JSON Data Dump unfortunately fell through due to a variety of factors. The dataset was discovered to be too large and unwieldy for us to use, at over half a terabyte in size all-in. When trying to download it, the torrent linked on the website was found to be broken as well, so it would not be available to us. Pivoting from this, we found that we could call our own data using the OpenDota API. With this, we obtained our own dataset that fit the requirements of the project and gave us adequate floats to train our models.\n",
